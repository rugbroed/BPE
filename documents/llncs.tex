\section{Project Proposal}
Natural resources are a precious commodity. Constructing resource efficient buildings makes sense, both in a political and economical perspective. Modern buildings today might come equipped with a suite of sensors and actuators, opening up for a degree of customizable control. Our collective need is that buildings can adapt to the users and the sensor-perceived environment, either automatically or manually. This can be achieved by developing policies that, based on input like semi-static data, dynamic data and sensor input, controls the actuators and thereby leading to the desired building state.

Since the task of specifying building policies typically resides in the area of Facility Management, we find it pertinent to interview company employees from positions within. We will conduct open ended interviews and document these by audio and/or video. The main purpose of the interviews is to document existing building policies and to facilitate the discovery of new, relevant policies that the employee requires - without taking the limitations of technology (like the expressiveness of a programming language) into account. We will analyze the interviews, and using Eclipse and EMF we will build a meta model for a domain specific language that is rich enough to express the policies. Using the model and Eclipse XText we will then develop the grammar needed, in order to have syntactical code completion in a running Policy Engine Editor based on Eclipse. Finally, we will use the Policy Engine Editor to write the policies.

We therefore base the validity of this project on the requirements of professionals working in Facility Management, and use their stated policies as requirements that will be implemented as grammar-passed code using the developed DSL.

If time permits, we might develop parts of the execution, compare the DSL to existing available software solutions og develop a visual editor.
