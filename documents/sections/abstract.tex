\begin{abstract}
The paper presents a Domain Specific Language (DSL) in the domain of building automation that aims at analyzing, controlling, and optimizing energy consumption --- and optimize human comfort --- in modern buildings. The main contribution is a large DSL build using Eclipse Modeling Framework and Xtext that captures the main concepts in this domain. Requirements were qualitatively elicited from six organizations in Denmark via semi-structured open-ended interviews. The paper describes the elicitation of these requirements, their implementation in a DSL (both abstract syntax and textual concrete syntax), an evaluation of the DSL by modeling parts of the interviewed organizations's buildings, and discusses future work.\end{abstract}
