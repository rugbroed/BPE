\begin{abstract}
Modern buildings often consist of many different types of sensors and actuators. It is a complex task to control and manage them, especially when aiming for optimal energy efficiency and human comfort. If easily specified automated control of buildings is achievable, the result would be reduction of energy usage and natural resources like gas and water. We specified a building's automation Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on requirements obtained from interviews with several large companies, and built it using Eclipse Modeling Framework and XText. The DSL is validated by implementing all the discovered policies.
